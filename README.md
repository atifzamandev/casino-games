# React app to display Comeon games

## Project overview

The purpose of this project is to utilize JSON backend to create login functionality and then display games to the logged in users where they can also search and filter games to play.

### Initial Project Setup

The project is created from scratch by installing the following packages/features which are being used to achieve the desired functionality and optimize app performance.

- TypeScript: Adds type safety to the code and catches errors at compile time.
- Semantic UI: For styling the app. It helps in developing visually appealing and responsive UIs.
- React Router DOM: To add navigation features and define routes in our single-page application.
- Axios: To make HTTP requests efficiently and handle automatic data transformation.
- React Query: To manage server state, data fetching, caching, and synchronization in a simpler and more efficient way.
- Prettier: To format the code in a standardized way.
- ESLint: To enforce consistent code quality and style across the app.

## Project Steps

### Step 1

Setup basic scaleable folder structure and clean up boilerplate to have clean code architecture. Creating routes displaying games. Completed React Query, created an API client to encapsulate the Axios logic, making the code more reusable, modular, and easier to maintain for different endpoints. Added API interfaces to show proper API data. Created API hooks to abstract the data-fetching logic and make them reusable. Also added React Query automatic caching and query management configurations.

### Step 2

Setup Semantic UI for styling. Designing homepage with logo and login form and after that adding login functionality.
